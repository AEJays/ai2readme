## Project Overview

This project helps you integrate project content and generate markdown, aiming to combine all scenarios that are convenient for programmers, such as changelog / readme / commit, allowing programmers to focus more on developing code.

### How Project Parts Are Obtained

1. **GitHub Repository Acquisition**: Mainly implemented through `git remote -v`, and the GitHub logos above require you to have set the `origin` git remote. Your repository must also be an open-source repository.

2. **Different Module Analysis for README**: Uses different prompts for AI analysis. The modules currently in use have undergone extensive testing, and you can replace them with prompts more suitable for your own modules. You can also add your own modules based on your modules.

3. In `ai2readme generate`, the main file is handled by default using the `main` field from `package.json`. Other types of code may not have a `package.json`, so I made it configurable for JavaScript projects to be more comfortable to use. The name is also default to the `name` field from `package.json` unless your project doesn't have one, in which case it will get the folder name. The `--config` mode is mostly for backend use, but frontend can also use it as long as you specify the configuration file (it will read your configuration file for the large model when needed).

4. All development here is based on `glm-4.6v-flash` generation. If you replace it or use ollama local models, please test it yourself.

## Author's Note

This README document is basically 60% generated by ai2readme, and I only modified a small part. The feature list is listed at the bottom. If you think this project is good, please give it a star. If you think this project is especially helpful and want to buy me a coffee, there's my Alipay QR code at the end. Thanks!

For convenience in modification, it is generally recommended to clone it and install globally. Currently, it does not support npm packaging, but support may be added later.

## Installation Method
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AEJays/ai2readme.git
```

## Usage

### How to Run

#### Prepare Environment
1. **Configure Environment Variables (Optional, only for Zhipu AI)**  
   Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`, then add the API key:
   The content of .env.example is as follows:
   ```env
   # Choose AI backend, optional zhipu or ollama
   AI_PROVIDER=zhipu
   # Zhipu AI's API key (go to https://open.bigmodel.cn/ to get)
   ZHIPU_API_KEY=<Your ZHIPU AI API Key>
   # Model provided by Zhipu AI, currently recommended free models
   ZHIPU_MODEL=glm-4.6v-flash # Currently Zhipu AI's free better model (tested to be usable)
   # Base URL for ollama service, default local port 11434
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
   # Local model name used by ollama
   OLLAMA_MODEL=<YourModel>
   ```

2. **Run Commands**  
   Use the `ai2readme` command, supporting the following subcommands:
   - `generate`: Generate project README
   - `translate`: Translate the generated README to English
   - `help`: Display help information

#### Command Examples
- **Generate README for the current directory**:
  ```bash
  ai2readme generate
  ```
- **Specify target directory and main file**:
  ```bash
  ai2readme generate ./my-project src/index.js
  ```
- **Translate the generated README (reads Chinese README => English README, only reads ./my-project/README.md)**:
  ```bash
  ai2readme translate ./my-project
  ```

#### Interactive Examples
1. **Display help information**:
   ```bash
   ai2readme
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Usage: ai2readme <command>  
   Commands:
     generate              Generate project README document (default command)
     translate             Translate the generated README to English
     help, --help, -h      Display help information
   Arguments:
                Target project path (default: current directory)
                 Project main entry file name (optional, used for analyzing core logic, as some logic requires analyzing all code to determine)
   Options:
     --config <file>       Specify configuration file path (optional, generally used to determine what configurations a project has)
   Examples:
     ai2readme
     ai2readme generate ./my-project src/index.js
     ai2readme translate ./my-project
     ai2readme help
     ai2readme --help
   ```

2. **Output after running the generate command**:
   ```bash
   ai2readme generate ./my-project
   ```
   Output:
   ```

| Robust Error Handling | Includes error logging and program exit mechanisms |

## Technology Stack

### Dependency Overview
The following are the Node.js dependencies used by the project, organized by functionality:

- **Tool Libraries**
  - `dotenv (^17.2.3)`: Loads environment variables for easy configuration management
  - `fs-extra (^11.3.3)`: Extends Node.js file system operations to support richer file operations
  - `ignore (^7.0.5)`: Provides file/directory ignore rules, commonly used to exclude specific files in build processes
  - `openai (^6.16.0)`: OpenAI API client, used to call OpenAI services (e.g., model calling, API interaction)

## Notes

⚠️ When using Zhipu AI service, you must set `ZHIPU_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in the project root directory, otherwise the program will fail to start and report an error.
⚠️ The AI service provider (`AI_PROVIDER`) must be configured as `"zhipu"` or `"ollama"`, otherwise the program will terminate and prompt an error.
⚠️ The target project path must contain valid code files (not in the ignore pattern), otherwise it will prompt "No valid files found" and exit.
⚠️ Code analysis limits: Maximum 100 lines per file, and up to 5 files analyzed.
⚠️ The translation feature requires generating a Chinese README.md first via the `generate` command, otherwise the translation command will error.
⚠️ If you want to add a new section, add the corresponding usable prompt in zh.js.
